![Wikipedia](/files/wikipedia.png)

You can not imagine what it represents for me : 2 weeks ago, while browsing a website about GIS (don't bother, geek stuff), I unconsciously clicked on a link which was supposed to lead me to the Wikipedia definition of another barbarian acronym. While realising I was redirected to Wikipedia, I started thinking I should close the current thumbnail. However I was not fast enough and something weird happened : I actually reached Wikipedia. I checked that I was not using a proxy service, and finally had to admit that Wikipedia was (at least for the moment) unblocked from China. Since then I have been fearing the restriction to come back, but nothing happened : it seems Wikipedia is finally accessible from China.
