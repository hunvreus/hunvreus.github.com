No, 白酒 did not drove me crazy to the point I bended my bike with my bare hands. This is actually my last acquisition in Shanghai ; the MECHA-BIKE (dramatic tone), most known as a folding bike (but mecha-bike sounds better).

I had been thinking for a while about buying a bike, mainly to go to my (so close) office. I will sure cut some money by not using cabs daily, but I will also enjoy the fact that I will not have to deal with... the SHANGHAIESE TAXI DRIVER (even more dramatic tone). I have noticed that more than 90% of Shanghaiese taxi drivers are physically unable to :

1. avoid traffic jams,
1. speak something else than (a sub-mutant) Shanghainese,
1. avoid yelling at you when you just woke up,
1. understand the first time you tell them you want to use your 交通卡,
1. avoid traffic jams (again),

I know declare myself independent and ready to brave by bike the dangerous and mystical rules of driving of this city !

PS : For those who actually expect me to say something worh reading it, this bike costs around 600 RMB and is pretty fast. It is alos light, and once folded you can store pretty much everywhere.

PS 2 : special thanks to Thomas for leading me to the mecha-bike reseller. Youhooouuuu !
