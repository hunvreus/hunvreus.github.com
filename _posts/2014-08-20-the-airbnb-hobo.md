CartoDB + OpenPaths

About 20 months ago I decided to not rent a place anymore. I was wrapping up a few business meetings in Washington DC and ralized my lease for my places in both SF and Shanghai were up for renewal, roughly at the same time. I decided I wouldn't renew them; [I had already been reducing my possessions to a bare minimum](/2013/02/10/about-not-owning-shit/) and I thought this was just the next logical step.

### Why the hell would you do that?

Let me first fill you in on what my last 7 months travels look like:

In these mere 7 months I've been 3 times to SF, 4 times to Shanghai, twice to DC and NYC, and once to Berlin, London and Paris. All for work. I usually stay between 2 and 8 weeks in each place.

[Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com) is opening an office in Berlin, with a strong customer base already in DC. I spend time in SF for [devo.ps](http://devo,ps), which is hopefully turning into my full time job sooner rather than later. We also happen to have a larger office in Shanghai (the reason of which I will need to write about one day, but definitely not why most people think).

I already had done a fairly good job at stripping my life of a lot of things, including booze and most social interactions. It was time to remove the concept of "home" as well.

Keep yourself on the edge
Force yourself to deconstruct
Force yourself to own less (move often)
Keeps you mobile

### How did that go?

I spent a good amount of this time living on [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), with maybe 20% of the time crashing at friends when convenient. I've tried pretty much anything, from

Not for everybody
I'm passionate w/ work and intelectual (probably borderline asperger)
Allows me to consider any location as my home (though haven't leveraged that yet)
First time spent a couple nights at bathhouse
Cheated by renting from or staying at friends directly a few times
Meet a lot of people
Kind of destroy your privacy and routine
But good > out of comfort zone
