There always comes a point after meeting new people where I find myself in a situation involving alcohol. Surprisingly quickly actually. I can dodge questions or order myself a soda water for a while, but invarably I'll get grilled about it, or pressured into "having just one glass". I then have to explain that I don't drink, but not for health reasons or because I'm an alcoholic. I simply choose not too. And surprisingly, I get a lot of shit aobut it.

### Why I don't drink

I quit beer probably 5 years ago, prefering it wine and avoiding poor quality alcohol. I drank less and less over the course of a couple years until, at 32nd birthday party (I believe) I realized I had completely lost interest in it. I didn't enjoy the buzz and even less the aftermath that even a single drink would have on my brain and body. I didn't like how loud and stupid it turned people into.
