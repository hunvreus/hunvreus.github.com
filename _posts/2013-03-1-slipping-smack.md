I remember how I forgot most of my past,
But what has managed to transcend this convenient trick of my brain
Is the sweet sourness of others.

Being left alone would have been a more enviable trait
But I stubornly kept throwing me and my own arrogance, unknowingly at these kids.
And they simply answered with what that cruelty of theirs.

And it took me a long time to understand what it meant,
Realizing that I would not be accepted among the circle of cool kids,
Because the cool kids were not.
