Not ownning anything, not even a place
Keep yourself on the edge
Force yourself to deconstruct
Force yourself to own less (move often)
Keeps you mobile
Not for everybody
I'm passionate w/ work and intelectual (probably borderline asperger)
Allows me to consider any location as my home (though haven't leveraged that yet)
First time spent a couple nights at bathhouse
Cheated by renting from or staying at friends directly a few times
Meet a lot of people
Kind of destroy your privacy and routine
But good > out of comfort zone
Map of trips for the past 6 months

- What it looks like (map)
- How this got started

About 20 months ago I decided to not rent a place anymore. I was wrapping up a few business meetings in Washington DC and ralized my lease for my places in both SF and Shanghai were up for renewal, roughly at the same time. I decided I wouldn't renew them; [I had already been reducing my possessions to a bare minimum](http://teddy.fr/2013/02/10/about-not-owning-shit/) and I thought this was just the next logical step.

First, let me provide you with a bit of context as to why one would do this. Here is a map of my travels for the past year:

In a mere 7 months I've been 3 times to SF, 3 times to Shanghai, twice to DC and NYC, as well as a short stunt in Berlin, London and Paris. All for work.
