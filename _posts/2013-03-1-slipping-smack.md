I remember how I forgot most of my past,
But what has managed to transcend this convenient trick of my brain
Is the sweet sourness of others.

Being left alone would have been a more enviable trait
But I stubbornly kept throwing my arrogance and myself along, unknowingly at these kids.
And they simply answered with that cruelty of theirs.

And it took me a long time to understand what it meant,
Realizing that I would not be accepted among the circle of the cool kids.

And I later realized I didn't get the same dictionary as the others,
Intersecting on the obvious but widely unique for what mattered.

It took me years to understand that my toppled confidence
Encouraged by the illusions of wisdom and safety the grown up projected
Just needed to crash hard in the ground of my beliefs and get rebuilt.

And crashed it did, at the speed of a metastasized heart,
Bouncing me far in an orbit that laced around my own fears and doubts,
Letting me see the whole of us, clenching in a shaking fear of the unknown.

I left it there,
With the others,
And alone,
I feel without fear.
