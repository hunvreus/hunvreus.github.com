![Running](/files/paris_workout.jpg)

So it's been nearly a month and a half and I didn't find time to write anything, nor did I show any major activity on Drupal.org. I still managed to commit a [new module](http://drupal.org/project/time_track), but beyond this I've mainly dedicated my time to a couple things off-scene that I will hopefully share here very soon; this includes launching my own company, [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com), with a small (but growing!) team of Drupal experts here in Shanghai.

Now there are a couple things that keep me motivated, one of them being the upcoming [DrupalCon Paris](http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/) this September, even more since the idea of [having a healthier DrupalCon](/2009/03/15/coder-sprint-or-how-to-have-a-healthy-drupalcon/) seemed to have found resonance in the community. So here we go: there is a poll running on to determine [what kind of sport you'd like to do at DrupalCon](http://groups.drupal.org/node/22825); do you feel like going for an early morning run before attacking sessions or are you more of the [Petanque and Pastis type](http://groups.drupal.org/node/22825#comment-78967)? Let us know: we're working on getting it things organized. And feel free to comment on other activities or games you would like to participate to.
