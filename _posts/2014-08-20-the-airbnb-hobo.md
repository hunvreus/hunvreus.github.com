Not ownning anything, not even a place
Keep yourself on the edge
Force yourself to deconstruct
Force yourself to own less (move often)
Keeps you mobile
Not for everybody
I'm passionate w/ work and intelectual (probably borderline asperger)
Allows me to consider any location as my home (though haven't leveraged that yet)
First time spent a couple nights at bathhouse
Cheated by renting from or staying at friends directly a few times
Meet a lot of people
Kind of destroy your privacy and routine
But good > out of comfort zone
